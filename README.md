# Polyglot Code Scanner

This is part of my Polyglot Code tools - for the main documentation, see <https://polyglot.korny.info>

## WORK IN PROGRESS WARNING

I'm doing a lot of changes right now - if you fetch the current code, things may break.

Especially note, I'm changed the data file formats created by the explorer and used by the scanner - I've added version number checks, but data files from the Scanner must match expectations of the Explorer, so for now it's a bit of "make sure you pull changes often" or things will break.

## A note about releases

In the (long-ish) gap since I last made a release, Travis has stopped supporting open-source so my builds no longer work.

More recent releases you will need to build yourself, until I get an alternative CI setup going.

## Intro

This application scans source code directories, identifying a range of code metrics and other data, and storing the results in a JSON file for later visualisation by the [Polyglot Code Explorer](https://polyglot.korny.info/tools/explorer/description/)

## Installation and running

See also <https://polyglot.korny.info/tools/scanner/howto> for more detailed instructions for fetching binary releases, and running the scanner.

To compile and run from source, you'll need [to install rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then from a copy of this project, you can build a binary package with:

~~~sh
cargo build --release
~~~

The binary will be built in the `target/release` directory.

### Running from source

You can also just run it from the source directory with `cargo run polyglot_code_scanner -- (other command line arguments)` - this will be slower as it runs un-optimised code with more debug information.  But it's a lot faster for development.

### Getting help

See <https://polyglot.korny.info> for the main documentation for this project.

You can get up-to-date command-line help by running

~~~sh
polyglot_code_scanner -h
~~~

## Ignoring files

Git ignored files in `.gitignore` are not scanned.

You can also manually add `.polyglot_code_scanner_ignore` files anywhere in the codebase, to list extra files to be ignored - the syntax is [the same as .gitignore's](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

## Usage

~~~text
polyglot_code_scanner [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [root]

USAGE:
    polyglot_code_scanner [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [root]

FLAGS:
    -c, --coupling           include temporal coupling data
    -h, --help               Prints help information
        --no-detailed-git    Don't include detailed git information - output may be big!
    -V, --version            Prints version information
    -v, --verbose            Logging verbosity, v = error, vv = warn, vvv = info (default), vvvv = debug, vvvvv = trace

OPTIONS:
        --years <git_years>
            how many years of git history to parse - default only scan the last 3 years (from now, not git head)
            [default: 3]
        --coupling-bucket-days <bucket-days>
            Number of days in a single "bucket" of coupling activity [default: 91]
        --coupling-min-bursts <min-activity-bursts>
            If a file has fewer bursts of change than this in a bucket, don't measure coupling from it [default: 10]
        --coupling-min-activity-gap-minutes <min-activity-gap-minutes>
            what is the minimum gap between activities in a burst? a sequence of commits with no gaps this long is
            treated as one burst [default: 120]
        --coupling-min-ratio <min-coupling-ratio>
            The minimum ratio of (other file changes)/(this file changes) to include a file in coupling stats [default:
            0.75]
        --coupling-time-overlap-minutes <min-overlap-minutes>
            how far before/after an activity burst is included for coupling? e.g. if I commit Foo.c at 1am, and Bar.c at
            2am, they are coupled if an overlap of 60 minutes or longer is specified [default: 60]
        --coupling-max-common-roots <coupling-max-common-roots>
            The maximum number of common ancestors to include in coupling e.g. "foo/src/controller/a.c" and
            "foo/src/service/b.c" have two common ancestors, if you set this value to 3 they won't show as coupled
        --coupling-min-distance <coupling-min-distance>
            The minimum distance between nodes to include in coupling 0 is all, 1 is siblings, 2 is cousins and so on.
            so if you set this to 3, cousins "foo/src/a.rs" and "foo/test/a_test.rs" won't be counted as their distance
            is 2 [default: 3]
    -o, --output <output>
            Output file, stdout if not present, or not used if sending to web server


ARGS:
    <root>    Root directory, current dir if not present

## Development notes

See also the `DesignDecisions.md` file 

### Running tests

To run a single named test from the command-line:

~~~sh
cargo test -- --nocapture renames_and_deletes_applied_across_history
~~~

The `--nocapture` tells rust not to capture stdout/stderr - so you can add `println!` and `eprintln!` statements to help you.

To remove some extra noise and blank lines, pipe the output through grep:

~~~sh
cargo test -- --nocapture renames_and_deletes_applied_across_history | grep -v "running 0 tests" | grep -v "0 passed" | grep -v -e '^\s*$'
~~~

### showing logs

Rust tests don't install a logger - normally you explicitly install loggers in your `main` which tests don't use.

To install a logger using the `fern` crate, add the following to tests:

~~~rust
use test_shared::*;
~~~

then

~~~rust
install_test_logger();
~~~

This sets up a simple logger which sends logs to stdout - make sure you also use the `--nocapture` parameter mentioned earlier.

### Pretty test output

If you want better assertions, your tests need to explicitly use the `pretty_assertions` crate:

~~~rust
use pretty_assertions::assert_eq;
~~~

## Releasing new versions

Releasing uses [cargo-release](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-release)

The basic process is:

* update the top CHANGELOG.md entry (under 'unreleased')
* commit and push changes
* release

~~~sh
cargo release --dry-run
~~~

or for a minor change 0.1.3 to 0.2.0 :

~~~sh
cargo release minor --dry-run
~~~
